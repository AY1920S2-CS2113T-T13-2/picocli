= Testing Completion with Expect and DejaGNU

The files in this directory allow testing bash TAB completion.
The tests use the https://www.gnu.org/software/dejagnu/[DejaGNU] framework,
which is written in https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/expect[Expect].
Expect in turn uses http://tcl.sourceforge.net/[Tcl] -- Tool command language.

The tests work by starting a bash session with a predictable configuration,
then sourcing some of the completion scripts in `src/test/resources`,
and sending strings to the shell that trigger the shell to print completion candidates.
The testing framework then asserts that these completion candidates are the expected ones.

== Setup
First, install DejaGNU:

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get install dejagnu
----

That will install the following packages:
dejagnu expect libtcl8.6 tcl-expect tcl8.6.

To get the `cmdline` and `textutil` packages used in `dejagnu.tests/lib/library.exp`, get `tcllib`:

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get install tcllib
----

== Running the Tests

I have not yet investigated how to automate this.
For now, just `cd` into the `dejagnu.tests` directory and run the `./runCompletions` script:

[source,bash]
----
cd src/tests/dejagnu.tests
./runCompletion -v # -v gives verbose output into the log directory
----

== TODO

* Ensure these tests are run automatically as part of the Gradle build
* Log files should be created in the `build` directory, not in `src/tests/dejagnu.tests/log`
* Figure out how the tests can be started from any directory
